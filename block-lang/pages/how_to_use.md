# How 2 use

This program is for making lambda calculus expressions.

Lambda consists of three elements
* Variables `x` is the green block
* Functions `λx.x` is the red block
* Applications `(λx.x) x` is the purple block

## Step by step example

Press `a` to make an application. The block will now follow your mouse cursor, until you click somewhere on the canvas.

Now press `f` ~~to pay respect~~ to make a function, and place it on the left side of the application.

Then press `v` to make a variable and place it on the top-half of the function.

Hover on the varible, press `c`, and then click the function block. Now the variable is bound to the function.

Make another function, place it on the right side of the application and insert a variable on the bottom.

Now hover the mouse directly on the frame of the application and press `r`. That will read the expression, show it in text form on the sidebar. It will also reduce the expression, and show the reduced expression in text form, below the original expression.
