# Threebly
### A simple, unfinished language written during langjam3

## Description
Note: I used extension ".thrb"

Sorry, this is a little bit of a mess. I'm no expert at building languages, nor at Haskell. (I'm sorry to all the haskell gurus out there). I just like Haskell. 
I did build this on windows since my Linux partition needs to be fixed, so these instructions were how I built it on windows, however I'm guessing its a similar process to Linux and MacOS.

Please don't judge my code too harshly. It's super limited in its functionality too since I wasn't able to put the whole 48hrs in.

## Build
`cd threebly`  
`cabal install -j`  

## Use
`/path/to/bin/threebly /path/to/input/file`
